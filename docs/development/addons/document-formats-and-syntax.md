# Document formats and syntax

Register a [DocumentFormat](../addon-api-reference/DocumentFormat.md) to add a file format. Declare its extensions in the manifest's `fileExtensions` as well, without leading dots. Hibi uses the manifest to recognize files before the addon loads.

## Choose the supported views

Every format supports source view, called `markdown` in the API. Include `side-by-side` in `views` when your format has a useful preview. Include `normal` only when it has an editable visual view. Set `editing: 'markdown'` only for formats that can use Hibi's Markdown editor without losing content.

The `Preview` component receives the source in `value` and the current document in `document`. Its `toolbar` prop is the host's pinned action area. Render shared [PreviewActions](../addon-api-reference/PreviewActions.md) into that target for compile, run, or export buttons.

## Connect formatting and highlighting

Set `formatting: 'markdown'` for Markdown-compatible formats. Otherwise, provide [DocumentFormatting](../addon-api-reference/DocumentFormatting.md): an action list and an `apply` function that returns a source edit. Returning `null` leaves the selection unchanged. This connects the shared toolbar and shortcuts to your format.

Register a [CodeLanguage](../addon-api-reference/CodeLanguage.md) for syntax highlighting and put its ID in the format's `codeLanguage`. Register format-specific rendering options through `registerDocumentSyntax()`. These entries appear while the addon is enabled.

Use `load` to import a parser when it is first needed. Existing registrations with a `language` object remain supported. A format can omit its own `language` when it uses `codeLanguage`, or when its source is plain text.

```typescript
context.editor.registerCodeLanguage({
  id: 'javascript',
  aliases: ['js'],
  load: () => import('@codemirror/lang-javascript').then(module => module.javascript().language),
})
```

Hibi shares an in-flight load across aliases. Disabling or removing an addon while its parser loads cannot restore that registration after it finishes.

## Support export

Implement `render(source, documentId)` to return `{ html, css }` for workspace export. Keep rendering separate from editing: a preview or export must not rewrite the source. Hibi sanitizes the resulting HTML before displaying the exported site.

Formats that execute document code need an explicit run action. Do not execute it when the document opens or when a preview refreshes. Native compilers belong in a bundled addon's native entry point.

## Extend Markdown

Use [MarkdownFlavor](../addon-api-reference/MarkdownFlavor.md) for a Markdown dialect or syntax extension, and [MarkdownSyntaxFeature](../addon-api-reference/MarkdownSyntaxFeature.md) for its settings toggle. Keep disabled syntax editable as source. Use a [MarkdownExtension](../addon-api-reference/MarkdownExtension.md) for a reversible source-to-body projection, such as frontmatter above the visual editor.

The Markdown, frontmatter, and Typst addons in `src/addons/` provide working examples. Disabling a format must never delete or rewrite its documents.

For an unchanged contiguous body, a `MarkdownProjection` can declare `sourceOffset`: its exact UTF-16 start in the input. Hibi validates and composes these offsets before allowing rich-text edits. Omit it for transformed or generated content; those projections remain readable but cannot receive exact rich-text fixes.

### Serialization caching

Set `serialization: 'block-local'` only when each top-level block can serialize independently and the document joins those blocks with two newlines. Hibi caches by immutable block, its index, the previous block, and document attributes. A serializer must not depend on other blocks, mutable external state, or a custom document-level join. Leave this property out to use full-document serialization.

Hibi primes the cache before editing and reuses unchanged blocks during typing. Structural edits may invalidate more blocks. Test cached output against the full Markdown manager across edits, mark boundaries, empty paragraphs, and custom nodes before opting in.

### Preserve source

Declare `preservation` with a `level` and a contract `version`. `semantic` allows equivalent Markdown serialization. `verbatim` keeps source bytes: a flavor with this level uses source editing, while a projection can keep an exact prefix and suffix around its editable body. Hibi validates a verbatim projection's `sourceOffset` and reconstructs those regions itself. If the projection cannot prove an unchanged body, rich view stays read-only.

Projection `priority` controls composition, with higher values first and stable feature IDs breaking ties. Frontmatter uses priority 1000. Change the preservation version when the parser or storage contract changes, independently of the addon release version.

Installed addons should also declare `syntax` in their manifest: each descriptor names the contribution's `id`, `kind` (`flavor` or `projection`), literal `markers`, and preservation contract. Set `fallback: 'source'` to protect recognized source while the addon is disabled, including before its code has ever loaded. `literal` is only suitable for semantic syntax that the built-in editor can preserve safely. Use distinctive markers; detection is conservative and can make matching documents read-only in rich view.

Syntax owners load during startup and cannot use deferred activation. Hibi checks that their declared contributions register with the matching preservation level and version. Enabling or disabling them rebuilds the editor from its current unsaved source; it does not convert documents or save over them.
